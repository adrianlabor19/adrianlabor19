# About Me
I'm an introvert, but I deeply appreciate people who stick with me despite my flaws.
I value kindness, respect, and family, and I believe that learning is a lifelong journey.
My personality is jolly as a way to cope with past struggles, but I tend to be quiet when mistreated.
I enjoy playing Call of Duty: Mobile and watching K-dramas in my free time.
Worship songs help me reflect and strengthen my spirituality.
